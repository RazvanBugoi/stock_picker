# stock_picker
This is an implementation of the [Stock Picker Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker) in Ruby for The Odin Project

#### Parameters
Array

#### Returns
A pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell

## Problems
Implement a method `#stock_picker` that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## What I used
Arrays, nested loops, conditionals, array methods

## What I learned
- How to use a nested loop to compare different elements of an array
- How to select only a part of an array and modify it with the `#map` method
- How to use local temporary variables inside a loop
